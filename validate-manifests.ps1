.SYNOPSIS
	Checks that info.json corresponds to a valid entry in repository.json.

.DESCRIPTION
	repository.json keeps an entry for every published release so that anything reading the
	manifest can still resolve an older version. This script validates that the file stays
	well formed as entries accumulate, and that the version in info.json is one of them.

	Run it with no arguments to check the working tree. Pass -Tag to additionally require that
	info.json matches the version being released.

.PARAMETER Tag
	Release tag to check info.json against. A leading 'v' is ignored.

.PARAMETER WarnOnly
	Report problems as warnings and exit successfully. Used for release candidate tags, whose
	versions are not expected to line up with the manifests yet.
